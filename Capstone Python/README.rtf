Project's Title: Hari - Peminjaman Buku.

It's a mini program to manage book borrowing database. It is a capstone project from a data science bootcamp I'm taking right now. This is my first python program that I made.

You can use this program to learn a basic python code. It contains def function, while loop, user input, conditional statement and dictionary data type.

Thank you.
