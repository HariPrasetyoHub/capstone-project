<h1>Predicting Customer Lifetime Value</h1>

### **1. About the Project:**

This is third project from my data science bootcamp. This project is about making a Machine Learning **Regression Model** to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in car insurance Company. 

### **2. The Process is Includes:**
1. Data Understanding 
2. Data Preprocessing (missing value, manage outliers, Log transform, encoding & scaling)
3. Model Benchmarking ( Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor and XGBosst Regressor)
4. Metric Evaluation (Mean Absolute Error & Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
5. Explanation and Interpretation (feature importance & SHAP Summary plot)

### **3. Project Objective:**
1. Know how to make a Machine Learning Model
1. Can handle data anomalies
2. Evaluate several model scores using metric evaluation
3. Practice to interpret the feature in the model
4. Try to apply ML model to the business

### **4. Dataset:**

|  | **Attribute** | **Data Type** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Vehicle Class | Object | 
| 2 | Coverage | Object | 
| 3 | Renew Offer Type  | Object | 
| 4 | EmploymentStatus | Object | 
| 5 | Marital Status  | Object |
